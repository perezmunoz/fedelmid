\subsection{Question 5}
\label{subsec:415}

We could use the in-game statistics for each player to assess his salary (points, rebounds, assists...). However these statistics do not always reflect properly the impact of a player. Since basketball is a team sport, the performance of a player relies heavely on the performance of his teammates. Advanced statistics have been developed to address these issues. 

In particular, \verb|win shares| are an estimation of the number of wins contributed by a player over a season. Lebron James had the most \verb|win shares| between 2008 and 2013 and won 4 MVP titles in these 5 years. James' worth is well-known among basketball circles but there are some players who are less recognized and have good \verb|win shares| values.

Furthermore the \verb|win shares| statistics are already on \url{www.basketball-reference.com} for each player in the table \verb|Advanced|. Retrieving the data would only require adding a line to \verb|get_statistics_player| in \url{Code/Part1/BS/player_statistics.py}.

We would thus advise team owners to look for discrepancies in the correlation between salary and \verb|win shares|.
