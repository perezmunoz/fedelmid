\subsubsection{Question 4.c}
\label{subsubsec:414c}

The metrics above can be represented in a cross-tabulation format through the use of the case statement. The query is called for one team and then repeated for all the teams in 2011-2012 season and each result is concatenated using \verb|UNION ALL|. The query can be found in \url{Data/Part2/question_4c_cross_tabulation_format.csv}.
The query shows the average age where team name is the first column for each row and year is the column. The query is then repeated and an \verb|UNION ALL| is performed to join each query. The process is repeated for each team (\verb|ATL BOS CHA CHI CLE DAL DEN DET GSW HOU IND LAC LAL MEM MIA MIL MIN NJN NOH NYK OKC ORL PHI PHO POR SAC SAS TOR UTA WAS|)
