\subsection{Question 2}
\label{subsec:312}
We decided to scrap the pages of all the players and not only the active ones, as the data could prove useful to assess the salaries of the players. However we also created a function \verb|active_players_BS| which return which players are active and which are not.

The players are classified according to the first letter of their last name. We first retrieve all the letters which have players whose name starts with it, from \url{http://www.basketball-reference.com/players}. For example, there is no player whose name starts with X. For a letter $c$, we then download the page \url{http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c} and extract the links to the players' page.

\subsubsection{Question 2.a}
\label{subsubsec:312a}
\paragraph{} The regular expression we use to retrieve the letters is: \mint{html}|<a href="/players/([a-z]+)/">[A-Z]+</a></td>|

The regular expression we use to identify the links to the players' page is the following:
\mint{html}|[^p]><a href="(/players/./.+)"|

\subsubsection{Question 2.b}
\label{subsubsec:312b}
\paragraph{}  The code we use to retrieve the letters with BeautifulSoup is:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,mathescape,fontsize=\small]{python}
for row in soup('td', {'class': 'align_center bold_text valign_bottom xx_large_text'}):
       letter = str(row.a.get('href').split('/')[2])
\end{minted}

The code we use to identify the links with BeautifulSoup is the following:
\begin{minted}[frame=single,linenos,mathescape,fontsize=\small]{python}
for player in soup.tbody.find_all('tr'):
        link = str(player.td.a.get('href'))
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Question 2.c}
\label{subsubsec:312c}
\paragraph{} We choosed to use the regex code because it is faster and use less memory. In fact, we ran 100 instances of both versions and obtained the following results:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
	\hline
	Method & Time & Memory size \\ \hline
	regex 	& 1.167 s & 2.6 MB \\ \hline
	BS & 3.911 s & 3.7 MB \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Those results were obtained using pre-downloaded pages to avoid measuring the download times.


Furthermore, the regex code is more readable since it contains less functions that need to called.
