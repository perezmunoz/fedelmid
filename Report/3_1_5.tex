\subsection{Question 5}
\label{subsec:315}
We thought that very well paid salaries may be explained by a phenomenon of exaggerated enthusiasm for specific players. To investigate this hypothesis, we decided to scrap the playoff statistics, that is to say statistics of teams that reached the final part of the competition. We thought that focusing on best teams and best players for each season could help us explain the highest salaries of players. These data were scraped on the page http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/ with the same technique as question 2 and 4, since they are also stored in a well-structured table on the website. Our recommendation to team owners is to consider players that appear in this page differently than other players. Even if we cannot verify our hypothesis that players appearing in playoffs roster are better paid than other, it would prove that high salaries are not decided in a reasoned and logical way. This piece of information could help them not to pay salaries that are not deserved and use this money for more efficient players.
