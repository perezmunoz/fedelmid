The metrics above can be represented in a cross-tabulation format through the use of the case statement. The query below is repeated for all the teams in 2011-2012 season and each result is concatenated using \verb|UNION ALL|.
The query below shows the average age where team name is the first column for each row and year is the column. The query is then repeated and an \verb|UNION ALL| is performed to join each query. The process is repeated for the following teams (\verb|ATL BOS CHA CHI CLE DAL DEN DET GSW HOU IND LAC LAL MEM MIA MIL MIN NJN NOH NYK OKC ORL PHI PHO POR SAC SAS TOR UTA WAS|)
